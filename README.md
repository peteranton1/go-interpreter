# Writing and Interpreter in Go

This project contains example code
for an implementation of an interpreter 
for a target language. 

The target language is a made up language called Monkey. 
Monkey is quite interesting but by no means a production 
quality language, and this implementation is also not 
production quality. Libraries were not used to code generate 
e.g. the lexers and parsers. Instead these were hand-coded.
This ensures that there is minimal magic, i.e. the coder 
knows how it all works.

The idea is that the journey is more important than 
the destination. Writing this software allowed me to 
understand the architecture and mechanisms better
through the act of implementation. 

This was also a non-trivial implementation for practice 
in the Go language.
